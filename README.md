# IngredientsBot
A Reddit bot called /u/IngredientsBot that chills in the subreddit **/r/SkincareAddiction** and gets called with the command **!ingredients <*search terms*>** to return the list of ingredients for a beauty product with the use of its own Web-Scraper.

## How to use
1. Must have a reddit account to be able to post on www.Reddit.com.
2. Navigate to subreddit **/r/SkincareAddiction**. 
3. Type in **!ingredients <*search terms*>** in your comment to summon the bot and it will reply with the list of ingredients for the beauty product you searched.

### Notes
- Bot search terms is currently limited to the search results from www.Beautypedia.com since it connects to my web scrapper that is only grabbing data from there. Working on implementing more web scrappers and/or creating my own database of products.
